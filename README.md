# ToyStoreManagement
: This project has two modules, Admin and User, both of which perform registration, authentication, and CRUD operations themselves. Administrators have permission to provide toy details i.e. can perform the CRUD operations. Users can browse toys, add them to a cart, and purchase toys. However, users cannot make changes in the admin area.
