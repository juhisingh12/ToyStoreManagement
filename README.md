TOY STORE MANAGEMENT DESCRIPTION:

This project has two modules: Admin and User, both of which perform registration, authentication, and CRUD operations themselves.

i) ADMIN

ii) USER

ADMIN Section :

Admin has two options:
i) NEW ADMIN REGISTRATION
ii) EXISTING ADMIN LOGIN

This project's goal is to oversee toy sales over the Internet. If a new retailer wishes to sell their toys online, they must utilize this application and register before they are allowed to log in. Administrators are authorized to execute CRUD operations, so they can supply toy details. A shopkeeper will be authenticated by this program during login, and if he is a registered shopkeeper, he will receive the following options: i) Admin Profile Section: Shopkeepers can choose to carry out several CRUD actions on their profile, including Fetch, Update, Delete, and more. ii) Toys Section: This part allows only the Shopkeeper to upload the details of the toys that are in his store. The Shopkeeper may also perform CRUD operations with the Toy Database based on toy availability and pricing adjustments.

USER Section :

The user has two options:
i) NEW USER REGISTRATION
ii) EXISTING USER LOGIN

Any user who wishes to buy toys using this application must first register. After completing the registration procedure, the user can log in. The login process is secured, meaning that the application will correctly authenticate users before allowing them to log in. After successful login, the user can access the following features: i) User Profile Section: On their profile, a user has the option to do many CRUD operations, such as Fetch, Update, Delete, and others. ii) Toy's Section: Within this section, users can view all the toys available in the shopkeeper's store simultaneously, allowing for easy comparison of prices then Users can proceed to purchase any toy at the lowest price. Before finalizing the purchase, users must add the desired toy to their cart. They also have the option to add multiple toys to their cart, depending on availability. Once the toys are in the cart, users must proceed to make the payment. If the user's wallet balance is insufficient to cover the total cart amount, the payment will not go through, requiring the user to top up their wallet before completing the purchase. After the payment is successfully processed, the shopping cart will be cleared.
